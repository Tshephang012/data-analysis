Insights from the Analysis
Sales Trends
The line chart shows clear seasonal patterns in sales, with noticeable spikes during certain months—possibly tied to promotional periods or holidays. This can help in planning inventory and marketing efforts.

Product Performance
The bar chart gives a clear picture of which product lines are bringing in the most revenue. Some categories stand out as top performers, which could guide decisions on where to focus sales and marketing efforts.

Sales Distribution
Looking at the histogram, we can see how sales amounts are spread out. Most sales seem to fall within a particular range, with a few high-value orders pulling the average up. This tells us a lot about typical order sizes and customer spending behavior.

Order Quantity vs. Sales
The scatter plot shows a positive relationship between the number of items ordered and the total sales value—as you’d expect. However, there are also some outliers where smaller orders resulted in higher sales, which could point to high-value items or bulk pricing effects.
