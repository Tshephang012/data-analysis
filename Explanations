Explanation of the Code
Loading the Dataset
We start by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv(), which allows us to work with the sales data in a structured format.

Exploring the Data
To get familiar with the dataset, we display the first few rows using .head(). We then check the overall structure with .info() to understand the types of data we're working with, and use .isnull().sum() to identify if there are any missing values that need to be addressed.

Cleaning the Data
Any rows with missing values are removed using df.dropna() to ensure our analysis is accurate and free from incomplete data.

Basic Analysis
We generate summary statistics with .describe() to get an overview of the numerical data, such as sales and quantities. Then, we group the data by product line to see how total sales differ across categories.

Visualizations
To better understand the data, we create a variety of charts:

Line Chart: Shows how sales change over time, helping us spot trends and seasonality.

Bar Chart: Compares total sales across different product lines, highlighting which ones perform best.

Histogram: Illustrates how sales amounts are distributed, revealing patterns like skewness or outliers.

Scatter Plot: Plots quantity ordered against sales to explore the relationship between how much was ordered and the resulting revenue.
